This is the prompt engineering handbook and its R code (using version 4.3) 
You will need RStudio to run this.
There is a already rendered PDF document which is the prompt engineering handbook.

Please only use in combination with the actual thesis! Some explanations are only done in the thesis, the prompt engineering handbook is only the result of that and therefore does not include every explnations regarding methodology for example.
